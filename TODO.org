- [ ] Beta
  - [ ] Timing of the animation is screwed on blur event
  - [ ] Special built-in "clean up" filters that are always applied before handing the texture to the preset shaders
    - Like the one we did to remove weird pixels from Jebaited
    - Flipping the image (horizontally/vertically)
    - Changing the tint
- [ ] Back-burner
  - [ ] Fork and rewrite gif.js in WebAssembly
    - Also get rid of the old coffee stuff
  - [ ] "Render & Upload to BTTV" button (should just automatically
    upload the newly generated emote on your BTTV account)
  - [ ] Download existing emotes from BTTV, FFZ and Twitch (by just name since it's unique for the whole platform)
  - [ ] Ability to pause the animation
  - [ ] Get rid of the "Render" buttons
    - Just rerender every time something changes
      - With WebAssembly sped up gif.js this will be especially nice
  - [ ] Smooth progress report on the first phase of the emote
    rendering (the OpenGL one)
